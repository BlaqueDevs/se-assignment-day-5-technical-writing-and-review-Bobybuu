- A well-placed **graph or chart** can instantly clarify trends, comparisons, or processes.  
- Example: Showing **a side-by-side table** of a poorly optimized vs. well-optimized SQL query is more effective than a long explanation.  

### **4. Engages Different Learning Styles**  
- **Text-heavy explanations** may not work for everyone.  
- Some people learn best by **seeing (visuals)**, others by **reading (text)**, and others by **doing (interactive examples).**  
- Interactive **code sandboxes** (e.g., JSFiddle, CodePen) let users test code instead of just reading about it.  

### **5. Clarifies Instructions & Reduces Errors**  
- **Example:** Compare these two ways to explain Git branching:  
  🔴 **Text-only explanation:**  
  *"To switch to a different branch, check out the branch using the `git checkout` command."*  
  ✅ **With an example & visual:**  
  ```bash
  git checkout feature-branch
  ```  
  *(+ Diagram showing branches and HEAD moving to a new branch)*
